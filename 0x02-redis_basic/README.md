# Redis Basic

## Tasks

### Task 0
Create a `Cache` class. In the `__init__` method, store an instance of the Redis client as a private variable named `_redis` (using `redis.Redis()`) and flush the instance using `flushdb`.

Create a store method that takes a `data` argument and returns a string. The method should generate a random key (e.g. using `uuid`), store the input data in Redis using the random key and return the key. `data` can be a `str`, `bytes`, `int` or `float`.

### Task 1
Redis only allows storing string, bytes and numbers (and lists thereof). Whatever you store as single elements will be returned as a byte string. Hence if you store `"a"` as a UTF-8 string, it will be returned as `b"a"` when retrieved from the server.

In this exercise we will create a `get` method that take a key string argument and an optional `Callable` argument named `fn`. This callable will be used to convert the data back to the desired format.

Remember to conserve the original `Redis.get` behavior if the key does not exist.

Also, implement 2 new methods: `get_str` and `get_int` that will automatically parametrize `Cache.get` with the correct conversion function.
